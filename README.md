## 📝 About Adasys  
**Adasys** (*Adaptive System*) is a **smart learning platform** developed as part of my **mini-project in 3rd year of engineering**. The system dynamically adjusts **question difficulty** based on student performance, enhancing personalized learning.

It features **two primary functions**:  
1. 👩‍🏫 **For Teachers** – Upload **questions, options, correct answers, and difficulty levels**.  
2. 🎓 **For Students** – Take tests with a **timer**. Questions adjust **dynamically** based on previous answers, creating a personalized experience.

🚀 **Final scores are curved using a custom algorithm, ensuring fair assessment!**
